	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I have over 20 years of experience designing and
	developing enterprise applications for the <strong>Z/OS</strong>
	environment.
	</p>
	<p>I extensively use the <abbr title="ComputerAided Software Engineering">CASE</abbr>
	tool <strong>CA Gen</strong> to design and develop <strong>CICS</strong>
	server/online transactions and batch applications using <strong>DB2</strong> as
	the DBMS.

	I also have significant experience designing and developing Z/OS applications
	using "native" mainframe languages and technologies such as <strong>COBOL, JCL,
	MQ, XML etc.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>My experience has been mostly developing applications for the following
	Australian Commonwealth goverment departments. Here is a brief summary of my
	most recent projects:
		<ul>
		<li>Dept of Home Affairs (September 2016 - Present) -
			<a href="ICS.html">The Integrated Cargo System (ICS)</a>
			is a email/web interfaced application for managing, profiling, calculating
			duty on cargo. It handles over 250,000 cargo reports and declartions.
			Its core consists of over 2000 servers and asynchronous triggered transactions
			executed on the mainframe. These all developed using CA Gen. My role was to help
			design a new component to maintain Import Permits.</li>
		 <li>Australian Taxation Office (April 2016 - September 2016)
		 	The Integrated Core Processing system is a consolidated "single accounting"
		 	system that replaces legacy applications handling all income estimation and
		 	taxation assessements. It consists of CICS transactions developed using
		 	COBOL and using DB2 as the database. My role was to work in a team using
		 	the AGILE devlivery methodology to implement changes to the system.</li>
		<li>Department of Jobs and Small Businesses (formerly Department of Employment
			Education and Worplace Relations) -
			- The Employment Services Systems is a web applications that uses
			server transactions designed and developed using <strong>CA Gen</strong>.
			It uses Microsoft's <strong>SQL Server</strong> as its DBMS</li>
		</ul>
