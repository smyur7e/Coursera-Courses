    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help
        him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels,
        the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you sraddled.
        The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground,
        thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
    </p>

        The machine became kown as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was
        made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad,
        not being practical for the transportation in any other place than a
        well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.

        The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when
        pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known
        as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker",
        since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the
        day made for an exremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad
        and indoor riding academies, similar to the roller rinks, could be
        found in large cities.
